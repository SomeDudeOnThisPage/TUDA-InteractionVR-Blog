## Downloads
* **Code**: The code for the unity project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/SomeDudeOnThisPage/TUDA-InteractionVR-HandsFreeLocomotionInteraction/tree/master). The actual project code is mainly located in [/Assets/InteractionARVR](https://github.com/SomeDudeOnThisPage/TUDA-InteractionVR-HandsFreeLocomotionInteraction/tree/master/Assets/InteractionARVR).
* **APK**: The APK can be downloaded from my [TUDA-Filesharing folder on my website](https://tuda.buhlmann.me/?dir=s3/InteractionARVR). Or you can obviously just build it yourself.
